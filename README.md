# Architecture 
The architecture pattern utilized for this project was model-view-controller, a commonly used architecture pattern for developing a user interface where the programming logic is divided into 3 elements that are connected. The model, the view, and the controller. The model basically defines the essential components of the app, in the case of our to-do list ‘Task Quack’ the model defines what a list is or what a task is. The view is the code that makes our application look nice as well as laying out the groundwork for how a user interacts with our application. Finally, the controller is the connection between the model and view; it receives input from our user and then decides what to do with it. 

# Technologies 
The technologies utilized for this project were Angular, Spring Boot, MySQL server and Postman. Angular was used for the purposes of creating our web page application framework. Spring Boot was utilized to assist with the creation of the backend of the application. MySQL server was used for database creation and storage. Postman was used to help with API development. Git & GitHub was used to create, store and manage our code and Kanban project board so that we could work collaboratively.

# Challenges 
Some big challenges I faced during the creation of this project was integrating everyone's code together; since their was a lack of knowledge on how to implement these tools especially struggle with Bulma SASS/CSS framworks and GitHub issue such as not knowing the right project director that was linked to GitHub repo. I wanted to create a login page for users to log into their own accounts, but it’s something that was left unfinished and an aspect I am planning to work on in the future.
